# judger
I had to serve a as judge for a scientific conference this past weekend. I created this simple unstyled Meteor app top allow entry of
three scores, calculate and average score and sort the papers I was judging in different categories for me.
Plans:
* add user management
* add a timer for the talk, and highlight or grey out disqualified papers
